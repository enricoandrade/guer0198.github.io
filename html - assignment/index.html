            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>I’m a freelance videographer originally from <abbr title="Sao Paulo">SP</abbr>, Brazil and now based out
                 of Ottawa, <abbr title="Canada">CA.</abbr><br> As a musician, husband, father, and all-around 
                 doer person, I love to see life from an optimistic perspective.</p>

           <p>2022 is a landmark for me. I just started to follow a student path, 
               seeking knowledge, but above all, pursuing to become a better person 
               understanding new cultures, and building new experiences.
            </p>
            <p>I’m on my 1<sup>0</sup> term at Algonquin College and I’m already 
                <strong>thrilled</strong> about what is to come in the future!

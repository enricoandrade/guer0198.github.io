            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <img src="images/rico.jpg" alt="Enrico picture profile" width="300">
            <p>I’m a freelance videographer originally from <abbr title="Sao Paulo">SP</abbr>, Brazil and now based out
                 of Ottawa, <abbr title="Canada">CA.</abbr><br> As a musician, husband, father, and all-around 
                 doer person, I love to see life from an optimistic perspective.</p>

                    Nothing can be done without hope and confidence."

            <p>In my spare time I love:
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing some blues on my electric guitar</li>
                    <li>Take some random street photos</li>
                    <li>Wasting time on my PS5</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
           <p>2022 is a landmark for me. I just started to follow a student path, 
               seeking knowledge, but above all, pursuing to become a better person 
               understanding new cultures, and building new experiences.
            </p>
            <p>I’m on my 1<sup>0</sup> term at Algonquin College and I’m already 
                <strong>thrilled</strong> about what is to come in the future!
